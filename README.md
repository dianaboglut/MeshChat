# Off-the-grid Emergency Network
> A decentralized ESP32 mesh network built using ESP-NOW for direct, low-power communication without Wi-Fi or internet!

# üìñ About
ESP-Mesh is a project that creates a self-organizing mesh network of ESP32 devices using the ESP-NOW protocol. The system enables devices to communicate directly without relying on routers, centralized infrastructure, or internet access.

This approach is perfect for isolated areas, distributed IoT systems, and emergency scenarios (earthquakes, forest fires, disasters) where traditional networks are unavailable or unreliable.

# ‚ú® Features
- Decentralized Mesh Network: Nodes dynamically join/leave and auto-reconfigure the network
- Handshake Protocol: Devices perform a handshake to integrate into the mesh
- MAC Address & Adjacency Tracking: Maintains a full list of nodes and routing paths
- Message Passing: Send messages with a structured payload (PAYLOAD, FROM, TO)
- Serial Commands:
  - LST GRID ‚Äì Show adjacency matrix
  - LST HS ‚Äì Show handshake history
  - ADD, DEBUG, HELP
- Isolation Detection: Nodes ‚Äúscream their name‚Äù when alone to find others
- Debug Mode: Easier testing with extra log information

# üí° Potential Applications
- Emergency communications in disaster zones
- Hiking or festival networks
- Distributed IoT sensor coordination
- Industrial environments with no centralized infrastructure

# üõ†Ô∏è Technologies
- Hardware: ESP32
- Protocol: ESP-NOW (direct device-to-device communication)
- Custom handshake & routing logic for dynamic mesh building

# üöÄ Getting Started
To get started with ESP-Mesh, follow these steps:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Set up ESP32 Environment
- Install Arduino IDE or PlatformIO
- Add ESP32 board support in your IDE
- Connect your ESP32 boards via USB

2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Required Libraries
- Install the ESP-NOW library (usually bundled with ESP32 SDK)
- Install any other libraries required by the code (check #include statements)

3Ô∏è‚É£ Build and Upload
- Open the project in Arduino IDE or PlatformIO
- Select your board and upload the firmware to each ESP32 node
- Once deployed, the devices will automatically start discovering and handshaking with each other to form the mesh network.

# üëã Thanks for checking out my project!
I had a blast building ESP-Mesh and learned a ton about mesh networks and embedded systems.
